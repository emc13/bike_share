- before I uploaded the datasets to BigQuery, I added "day_of_week" and "ride_length" columns in Excel. 
I used the =WEEKDAY function to find the day of the week, and found the ride length by subtracting the 
started_at column from the ended_at column. I formatted the ride length column as time ("37:30:55"). I 
then checked the cell formatting for the other columns and changed the started_at and ended_at columns 
to date and time formatting -

**finding the amount of rows in the combined data**

SELECT 
  COUNT(*)
FROM `capstone-398715.bikeproject.combined_data`

**checking that the data only has 3 distinct types of bike. the table has only the 3 bike types**

SELECT 
DISTINCT(rideable_type)
FROM `capstone-398715.bikeproject.combined_data`

**checking that rows only have positive values for their ride length. the query shows that table had a 
few rows with null values for ride lengths and ride lengths equal to 00:00:00 minutes**

SELECT 
  ride_id,
  start_station_name,
  ride_length
FROM `capstone-398715.bikeproject.combined_data`
ORDER BY ride_length

**checking that the count of unique station ids and names are the same. the returned query shows there are some
station ids corresponding to multiple stations**

SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT start_station_id),
  COUNT(DISTINCT start_station_name)
FROM `capstone-398715.bikeproject.combined_data`

**finding which station ids correspond to multiple stations, and the number of unique stations they correspond to**
