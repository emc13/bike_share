# bike_share project
This repository contains SQL code I wrote in BigQuery to explore, clean, and analyze data as a part of a project for the Google Data Analysis certificate.

In this case study I analyzed Cyclistic's [data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) from July 2022 to July 2023. Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago. The company is looking to increase profit by converting casual riders (nonmembers) to members. The goals for this project were to compare how casual riders (nonmembers) and members use bikes, to identify trends between the two groups, and to provide data-based marketing strategy recommendations.

## Key Findings 
### 1. Differences between Casual Riders and Members
   - Most used stations vary by group
     - Members: Kingsbury St & Kinsey Street
     - Casual Riders: Streeter Dr & Grand Ave
   - Casual Riders ride the most on the weekends while Members ride most on weekdays
     - Member's most popular day: Thursday
     - Casual Rider's most popular day: Saturday
   - Members use electric bikes less than Casual Riders
     - Members: 37.65%
     - Casual Riders: 42.67%
   - Casual Riders use the top 10 stations more than Members
     - Members: 7.03%
     - Casual Riders: 13.25%
   - Members have shorter average ride times
     - Members: 12:15 minutes
     - Casual Riders: 22:52 minutes
### 2. Overall Trends
  - Decline in rides during the fall and winter months
  - Classic Bikes are the most popular
  - The 'Wells St & Concord Ln' station is in the top 10 used stations for both Members (3rd) and Casual Riders (8th)

## Recommendations
1. Heavily promote membership plans at the top 10 stations since casual riders use those stations at higher percentages than members.
2. Promote memberships on the weekends since more casual riders ride on the weekend compared to weekdays.
3. Create ads that emphasize the fun and ejoyment of riding a bike since casual riders appear to use bikes more for leisure than commuting.
4. Highlight electric bikes in advertising since casual riders use them close 42.7% of the time.
