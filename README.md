# bike_share
This repository contains SQL code I wrote in BigQuery to explore, clean, and analyze data as a part of a project for the Google Data Analysis certificate.

In this case study I analyzed Cyclistic's [data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) from July 2022 to July 2023. Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago. The company is looking to increase profit by converting casual riders (nonmembers) to members. The goals for this project were to compare how casual riders (nonmembers) and members use bikes, to identify trends between the two groups, and to provide data-based marketing strategy recommendations.
