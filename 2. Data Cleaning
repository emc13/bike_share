- looking for station names with improper values (ex. "&" or ":"). The start station has 2 mistyped entries
"Public Rack - Kedzie Ave &amp; 62nd Pl" and "Public Rack - Pulaski Rd &amp; 65th St" -

SELECT
 start_station_name
FROM `capstone-398715.bikeproject.combined_data`
WHERE (start_station_name LIKE '%;%'
  OR start_station_name LIKE '%!%'
  OR start_station_name LIKE "%:%"
  OR start_station_name LIKE "%>%"
  OR start_station_name LIKE "%<%")
GROUP BY start_station_name

- updated the 2 mistyped stations to the correct station name -

UPDATE `capstone-398715.bikeproject.combined_data`
SET start_station_name = 'Public Rack - Pulaski Rd & 65th St'
WHERE start_station_name = 'Public Rack - Pulaski Rd &amp; 65th St'

UPDATE `capstone-398715.bikeproject.combined_data`
SET start_station_name = 'Public Rack - Kedzie Ave & 62nd Pl'
WHERE start_station_name = 'Public Rack - Kedzie Ave &amp; 62nd Pl'

    
- cleaned the data and saved the results as a new table -
